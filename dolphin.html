    <p>
      There are 36 species of dolphins living in oceans, coastal, estuarine, and freshwater.
      They live in temperatures from less than 0 degrees celsius to more than 30 degrees celsius.
      The Amazon river is home to four species of dolphin that are not found anywhere else in the world.
      Bottlenose dolphins are usually slow swimmers, swimming at about 2 mph but they can reach speeds over
      30 mph for brief moments. Dolphins produce bubbles to herd their prey to the surface.
