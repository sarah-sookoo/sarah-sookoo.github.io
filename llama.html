      Llamas are members of the camelid family so they are closely related to camels.
      They can grow as much as 6 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 450 pounds. They can
      carry 25 to 30 percent of their body weight. They are well suited for harsh environments like
      rocky terrain and high altitudes. They don't bite but do spit when agitated. They also kick and 
      neck wrestle. Llamas live to be about 20 years old. Llamas are social animals. They prefer to live with other
      llamas or herd animals. The current population of llamas in South America is estimated to be more than 7 million.
