      Elephants, especially the African Savanna elephant, are the largest land animal. 
      They are about 3 meters tall and weight up to 6,000 kilograms. Males reach their full size
      at 35-40 years old which is more than half of their lifespan as they can live for up to
      60-70 years. The elephant's trunk alone has around 150,000 muscles. The trunk is used eat and 
      drink. It is also used as a snorkel when swimming. Their tusks are actually teeth which first
      appear when the elephant is 2 years old. Tusks continue to grow all throughout the elephant's life. 
      Elephants eat grass, leaves, shrubs, fruits, and roots. They eat so much that they can spend up to 
      three quarters of their day eating.
