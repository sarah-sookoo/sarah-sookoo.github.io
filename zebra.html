      There are three different species of zebra. Plains zebra, Grevy's zebra and mountain zebra. They are all 
      native to Africa. The most common species is the plains zebra who mainly roam around
      grasslands and woodlands. Zebras are closely related to horses as they have thick bodies, 
      thin legs, a tuffed tail and a long head. Their most well known feature is the black and white striped coat!
      Each of the individual stripes on a zebra is unique which helps them recognize each other. They are very social
      animals as they live together in groups called herds.
